# Getting Started

This section is for getting up-to-speed with elba as fast as possible, covering getting elba installed on your machine in the first place and making a new project.

By the end of this chapter, you should have a basic elba installation up-and-running, as well as a general overview of how to use elba for day-to-day Idris development.
